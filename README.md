# Console-Clock

This is a console application that displays the time as a custom font made from a string of 0. 
Arranging these 0's a certain way allows for custom text to be written in the console. 
An asynchronous function was used and it uses a Task.Delay of 1sec and then displays the next set of text.

Application Notes :

-Application needs to be in fullscreen to view time properly.
-Also wanted to display the date but i was getting errors at the time of upload. ShowDate() code has been commented out for now.
